## Installation

The application will load up in the browser without having to install.  Installation is only required if you wish to modify the source code.  This assumes you have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

1.  Run 'npm install'  
2.  Run 'gulp install'

## Getting Started

We have tried to make developing applications as easy as possible. If you have not already gotten the live reload plugin please do so with the link below in order to see changes you make live in the browser.

### Dependencies
* [Chrome Live Reload Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)

After you Have installed the project using the [installation instructions](#installation). Then you are ready to start building the applications. We use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to do all of our projects, but this is by no means exclusive to that program. If you aren't using Sublime Text then skip to the [Other RTE](#other-rte) section.

### Sublime Text  

1. Open Sublime Text project file located in root. (MadnessApp.sublime-project)
2. In menu toolbar select "Tools" -> "Build System" -> "Gulp" (You will only do this the first time you open the project)
3. Select "Tools" -> "Build" (Ctrl + B) to begin making changes.
4. Open browser to project and click the Live Reload extension making sure the black dot fills in on the icon.

That's it! Now when you make changes to the files in "src/", "public/html", or "public/index.html" the browser will reload to show changes auto-magically.

This app structure was made by the good people at [Madness Labs](http://madnesslabs.net) and is **OPEN SOURCE**.  What good is making a brilliant application development process if you don't let others use it.  Enjoy! ^_^
